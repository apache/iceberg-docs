Spark is currently the most feature-rich compute engine for Iceberg operations. We recommend you to get started with Spark to understand Iceberg concepts and features with examples. You can also view documentations of using Iceberg with other compute engine under the Engines tab.
Using Iceberg in Spark 3 # To use Iceberg in a Spark shell, use the --packages option:</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.0/spark-configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.0/spark-configuration/</guid><description>Spark Configuration # Catalogs # Spark 3.0 adds an API to plug in table catalogs that are used to load, create, and manage Iceberg tables. Spark catalogs are configured by setting Spark properties under spark.sql.catalog.
This creates an Iceberg catalog named hive_prod that loads tables from a Hive metastore:
spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod = org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod.type = hive spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod.uri = thrift://metastore-host:port # omit uri to use the same URI as Spark: hive.</description></item><item><title>DDL</title><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.0/spark-ddl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.0/spark-ddl/</guid><description>Spark DDL # To use Iceberg in Spark, first configure Spark catalogs.
Iceberg uses Apache Spark&amp;rsquo;s DataSourceV2 API for data source and catalog implementations. Spark DSv2 is an evolving API with different levels of support in Spark versions. Spark 2.4 does not support SQL DDL.
Spark 2.4 can&amp;rsquo;t create Iceberg tables with DDL, instead use Spark 3.x or the Iceberg API.

Stored procedures are only available when using Iceberg SQL extensions in Spark 3.x.
Usage # Procedures can be used from any configured Iceberg catalog with CALL. All procedures are in the namespace system.
CALL supports passing arguments by name (recommended) or by position. Mixing position and named arguments is not supported.
Named arguments # All procedure arguments are named.</description></item><item><title>Queries</title><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.0/spark-queries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.0/spark-queries/</guid><description>Spark Queries # To use Iceberg in Spark, first configure Spark catalogs.
