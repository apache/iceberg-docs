Table metadata and operations are accessed through the Table interface. This interface will return table information.

schema returns the current table schema spec returns the current table partition spec properties returns a map of key-value properties currentSnapshot returns the current table snapshot snapshots returns all valid snapshots for the table snapshot(id) returns a specific snapshot by ID location returns the table&amp;rsquo;s base location Tables also provide refresh to update the table to the latest version, and expose helpers:</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/flink/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/flink/</guid><description>Flink # Apache Iceberg supports both Apache Flink&amp;rsquo;s DataStream API and Table API.

That means we can just create an iceberg table by specifying 'connector'='iceberg' table option in Flink SQL which is similar to usage in the Flink official document.
In Flink, the SQL CREATE TABLE test (..) WITH ('connector'='iceberg', ...) will create a Flink table in current Flink catalog (use GenericInMemoryCatalog by default), which is just mapping to the underlying iceberg table instead of maintaining iceberg table directly in current Flink catalog.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/configuration/</guid><description>Configuration # Table properties # Iceberg tables support table properties to configure table behavior, like the default split size for readers.

You can evolve a table schema just like SQL &amp;ndash; even in nested structures &amp;ndash; or change partition layout when data volume changes. Iceberg does not require costly distractions, like rewriting table data or migrating to a new table.
For example, Hive table partitioning cannot change so moving from a daily partition layout to an hourly partition layout requires a new table. And because queries are dependent on partitions, queries must be rewritten for the new table.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/maintenance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/maintenance/</guid><description>Maintenance # Maintenance operations require the Table instance. Please refer Java API quickstart page to refer how to load an existing table. Recommended Maintenance # Expire Snapshots # Each write to an Iceberg table creates a new snapshot, or version, of a table. Snapshots can be used for time-travel queries, or the table can be rolled back to any valid snapshot.
Snapshots accumulate until they are expired by the expireSnapshots operation.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/partitioning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/partitioning/</guid><description>Partitioning # What is partitioning? # Partitioning is a way to make queries faster by grouping similar rows together when writing.
For example, queries for log entries from a logs table would usually include a time range, like this query for logs between 10 and 12 AM:
SELECT level, message FROM logs WHERE event_time BETWEEN &amp;#39;2018-12-01 10:00:00&amp;#39; AND &amp;#39;2018-12-01 12:00:00&amp;#39; Configuring the logs table to partition by the date of event_time will group log events into files with the same event date.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/performance/</guid><description>Performance # Iceberg is designed for huge tables and is used in production where a single table can contain tens of petabytes of data. Even multi-petabyte tables can be read from a single node, without needing a distributed SQL engine to sift through table metadata. Scan planning # Scan planning is the process of finding the files in a table that are needed for a query.
Planning in an Iceberg table fits on a single node because Iceberg&amp;rsquo;s metadata can be used to prune metadata files that aren&amp;rsquo;t needed, in addition to filtering data files that don&amp;rsquo;t contain matching data.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/reliability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/reliability/</guid><description>Reliability # Iceberg was designed to solve correctness problems that affect Hive tables running in S3.
Hive tables track data files using both a central metastore for partitions and a file system for individual files. This makes atomic changes to a table&amp;rsquo;s contents impossible, and eventually consistent stores like S3 may return incorrect results due to the use of listing files to reconstruct the state of a table. It also requires job planning to make many slow listing calls: O(n) with the number of partitions.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/schemas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/schemas/</guid><description>Schemas # Iceberg tables support the following types:

spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod = org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod.type = hive spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod.uri = thrift://metastore-host:port # omit uri to use the same URI as Spark: hive.metastore.uris in hive-site.</description></item><item><title>DDL</title><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/spark-ddl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/0.13.1/spark-ddl/</guid><description>Spark DDL # To use Iceberg in Spark, first configure Spark catalogs.
